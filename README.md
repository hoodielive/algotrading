## What is an asset class?

An asset class is a grouping of investments that:
- exhibit similar characteristics
- are subject to the same laws and regulations
- often behave similarly to on another in the marketplace

Example: Equities/Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA)
- There is usually very little correlation (or even negative correlation) between different Asset Classes

Example: Low Correlation between equities/stocks and fixed income
- Financial advisors focus on Asset Classes to help investors diversify their portfolios.
- Each Asset Class is expected to reflect different risk and return investment characteristics and perform
differently in any given market environment.
