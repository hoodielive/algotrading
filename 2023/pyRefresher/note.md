Compounding Interest

Future Value (FV) - Compounding 

Ex:
You save 100 USD for one year at an interest rate of 3%.
You save 100 USD for 3 years at an interest rate of 3% p.a.

Formula: 
FV = PV(1 + r) n

FV, Future Value
PV, Present Value
r, interest rate (per period)
n, number of periods

Present Value - Discounting
